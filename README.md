## Hierarchical Task Networks :id=main

[HTN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_task_network) is a paradigm for making AI that plans ahead instead of making decisions on a moment-to-moment basis.
HTN-driven AIs can take into account the consequences of their actions and create optimal plans to be executed.

## Features

The plugin provides a suite of tools for creating, editing and debugging HTN-based AI.

- Node-based HTN graph editor
- Ability to make custom Tasks, Decorators, and Services in both C++ and Blueprints
- Parallel planning
- Any-order planning
- High modularity due to decoupling of preconditions from tasks
- Integration with the Visual Logger
- Integration with the Environment Query System
- Realtime debugging features

## Why HTN?

Traditional AI techniques have characters make decisions on a moment-to-moment basis â€“ be it with simple if statements, state machine transitions, or behavior tree branching points. Having no foresight, this may lead to suboptimal behavior.

### A simple example

![A simple test situation](_media/simple_test_1.png ':size=1200')

The red character needs to shoot the tall yellow target. 
Before the character can shoot the target, they need to get a gun an some ammo for it, in no particular order.
There are two guns on the ground and two ammo crates in different locations.

There are multiple choices the character needs to make. 
Should it get a gun or ammo first? 
Which ammo crate or which gun to go to?
Where to shoot at the target from?
These choices affect how much the character will have to walk before shooting at the target, so only one possible sequencing of actions is the optimal one.

A simple solution, easy to make with traditional AI would be to go to closest item (gun or ammo), then go to the closest remaining item (gun if first went to ammo, ammo if first went to gun), then move to the closest location from which the target can be shot. While workable and easy to implement, this solution will almost never produce the optimal sequence of actions. In this example, the character would go for the ammo crate on the right, then the gun on the left, then go back to the doorway on the right before shooting. There's a lot of backtracking and wasted effort.

The optimal plan is in fact to go to the gun and the ammo crate further away, and use the doorway next to them:

With HTN it's easy to create a character AI that efficiently finds the optimal plan, with no more effort required than making a behavior tree. Here's the HTN asset that drives the character in this example:

### HTN for tactics

Suppose there is an FPS arena with a complex layout. There are two groups of characters fighting each other with guns and grenades. A character needs to approach the enemy while staying in cover, and optionally throwing grenades along the way.

There are myriad ways to go from point A to point B while moving from cover to cover. Every step of the way presents a unique choice: to go left or to go right, to run straight through or take a detour, to throw a grenade or to hunker down etc. The tactical consequences of each choice aren't obvious in the moment, which is why it's better to plan them out in advance. A planning-based AI is perfect for this kind of situation, as it finds the best (lowest cost) plan even in a highly-branching possiblity space.

This situation is implemented in the "TacticsTest" map of the example project. Characters invent plans and continuously update them as the battlefield conditions change.
