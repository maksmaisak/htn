The Search tab (summoned with `Ctrl + F`), allows for searching through the nodes of an HTN graph. Selecting multiple search results in the Search tab also selects the nodes in the editor, so it's easy to bulk-edit nodes that match a search query.

## Combined queries

If a search query is written as "some text | some other text", the editor will search for the text on either side of the "|" separately and combine the results. The image below shows a search for anything with "ammo" or "firearm".
