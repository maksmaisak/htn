## Example project

Also consider the [example project](https://github.com/maksmaisak/htn-example-project) for examples of usage of all main features of the plugin.
The project includes two maps with HTN-based characters:

- `SimpleTest` – a map with a character making the optimal plan to achieve a simple goal.
- `TacticsTest` – a map with two groups of characters fighting using guns and grenades, utilizing tactical reasoning in their planning.
